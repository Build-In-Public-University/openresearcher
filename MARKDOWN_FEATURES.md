## Healthcare AI Implementation Guide

Based on your research context, here's how to implement **healthcare AI techniques**:

### 1. **Data Preparation**
• Ensure your medical imaging data is properly labeled
• Use `DICOM` format for medical images
• Implement data augmentation techniques

### 2. **Model Selection**
> **Recommendation**: Start with pre-trained models like ResNet or EfficientNet for medical imaging tasks.

### 3. **Implementation Steps**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Apply medical-specific augmentations
   - Split data into train/validation/test sets

2. **Model Training**
   - Use transfer learning from ImageNet weights
   - Implement early stopping
   - Monitor for overfitting

### 4. **Ethical Considerations**
Since you're interested in ethical AI, remember to:
• Ensure patient privacy compliance (HIPAA)
• Address algorithmic bias
• Maintain transparency in decision-making
```

## 🎯 Context-Aware Formatting

The AI uses your research context to:
- **Reference your interests** in responses
- **Connect new information** to your existing work
- **Suggest follow-up research** based on your patterns
- **Provide personalized insights** tailored to your focus areas

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Components**
- `Markdown` component in `client/src/components/ui/markdown.tsx`
